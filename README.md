## About:
Share more, experience more.
Cameraless Concerts relieves the pressure of taking photos at concerts, because more than likely someone else is already doing that for you. Whether it be you forgot your camera or your phone died, our aim is to have collective sharing of concert photos so more time is spent enjoying the show.
